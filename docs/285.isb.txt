% This film was supposedly based loosely on Nargis's life, atleast the
% earlier parts are.   Nutan is treated very badly by her uncle and aunt
% (she is an orphan) until they find out what a good singer she is.  When
% she becomes a famous filmstar, they rally around to be part of her
% money.   This song is the first time Nutan sings in public, not because
% she wants to but because she runs onto the stage to escape a local goonda
% who is trying to rape her.   The song expresses the character's
% disillusionment with life and the society around her.
% This is a very beauiful tune and very very un-Nayyaresque tune.   The
% whole song is set to a fairly high pitch, possibly for dramatic value and 
% excellently sung by Asha.   I don't know if these lyrics are exceptional
% but I love the accusatory quality.   I see them as words written in anger,
% not helplessness.
