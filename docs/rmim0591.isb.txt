%    Film - ka.nchan / kanchan. Chitra Productions.
%
%    The song is wrongly attributed to Parul Ghosh and
%    Leela Chitnis in HFGK. There is only one female
%    voice in it. The male voice is Muzumdar's.
%
%    The film Kanchan also features the first ever
%    film-song composed by Naushad : 'bata do sakhi kaun
%    gali gaye shyam'; but it was released an year after
%    Prem Nagar (1940), Naushad's first film as sole MD.
%    Naushad's song is quite pedestrian.
