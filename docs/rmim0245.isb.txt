(i'm falling in love with a stranger) \-2
the night tonight has a flavour of love
i'm falling in love with a stranger

laa laa laa laa laa laa
laa laa laa laa laa laa laa laa

(your touch is so tender
there is something to remember) \-2
(of you) \-2

(i'm falling in love with a stranger) \-2
the night tonight has a flavour of love
oh i'm falling in love with a stranger
