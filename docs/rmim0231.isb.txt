% The song was originally recorded for the unreleased
% film Kaaminii in Aug/Sept 1949; it was later used
% in Ramman. The film Kamini is covered only in the
% first edition of vol 3 (1951-60) of the Geet Kosh.
% The second edition just mentions it in passing on
% page 593. The '40s edition does not mention 'Kamini'
% because the film's correct date was discovered after
% its publication in 1984.
